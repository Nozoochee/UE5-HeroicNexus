This is a mirror of my project. During development I am using perforce.

To run:
Go into the folder
If you don't own the "Electronic Nodes" and "Node Graph Assistant" plugins, open the .uproject file in a text editor and set "Enabled: false"
Right click .uproject file -> Generate Visual Studio Solution
Open and build inside VS or Rider

Once you're in the editor, press play, look at the mannequin across and press F
A duel should start and both players draw their cards (nothing more will happen after that)

ALL ART IS PLACEHOLDER AND WILL BE REPLACED ONCE ORIGINAL ASSETS HAVE BEEN CREATED

This project uses the SQLiteGameDb plugin https://github.com/Ysgrathe/SQLiteGameDb/
