# Heroic Nexus

This is a screenshot of my WIP game Heroic Nexus, built in Unreal Engine 5.2. During development I am using perforce.

## To run:
- Go into the folder
- If you don't own the `Electronic Nodes` and `Node Graph Assistant` plugins, open the .uproject file in a text editor and set "Enabled: false"
- Right click the `.uproject` file -> `Generate Visual Studio Solution`
- Open and build inside VS or Rider

Once you're in the editor, press play, look at the mannequin across and press F.

A duel should start and both players draw their cards (nothing more will happen after that)

This project uses the `SQLiteGameDb` plugin https://github.com/Ysgrathe/SQLiteGameDb/

The .db file can be found in Content/Database

ALL CARD ART IS PLACEHOLDER AND WILL BE REPLACED ONCE ORIGINAL ASSETS HAVE BEEN CREATED
